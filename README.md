👋 Hi, I’m Margaret YJ Kim, UX Producer(Project Manager) at Thomson Reuters.
👀 I’m interested in bringing people and ideas together and producing excellent outcomes for the users and while aligning with the company’s vision and goal.
🌱 I’m currently learning to improve the design operations process so that the team can function seamlessly by building better communication and tighter operations on the right resources while aligning with key stakeholders and communicating with our Product and Tech partners.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to make magic happen when you have diverse talents in a team but you need someone to figure out "how" and connect the dots, because my superpower is building teams to collaborate and create sustainable and repeatable processes.
🍓 On weekends, you can find me going through a list of dessert shops with the best strawberry desserts in Toronto.
